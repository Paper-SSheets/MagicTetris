# MagicTetris
An implementation of the standard Tetris game that implements "magic" blocks, which allow the game to enter "gravity mode" if 3 or more of said blocks are in the same row when the row is filled. One can move the magic within the blocks by selecting the space bar. Created for a course at Iowa State, COM S 227: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming.
